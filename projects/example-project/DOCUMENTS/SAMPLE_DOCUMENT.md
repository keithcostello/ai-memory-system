## Overview

[Brief description of what this document covers]

This is a sample document in the DOCUMENTS directory, which is part of the three-tier storage model:
1. **PROJECT/** - Project management and cross-session memory
2. **SESSION/** - Session-specific interactions and chat logs
3. **DOCUMENTS/** - Project-specific content and deliverables

The DOCUMENTS directory is where you store all project-specific content that doesn't fit into the PROJECT or SESSION directories. This includes technical specifications, design documents, research findings, meeting notes, and other deliverables.
