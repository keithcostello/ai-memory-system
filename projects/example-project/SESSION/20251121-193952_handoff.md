# AI Handoff: memory-repo

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
**IMPORTANT: Receiving AI must answer these before proceeding.**

1. What repository structure pattern does this project follow?
2. What is the main task currently in progress?
3. What specific document should be updated next?

## ESSENTIAL FILES (READ IN THIS ORDER)
1. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/WAITING_ON.md` - Current status and immediate next actions
2. `PERSISTENT_MEMORY_LITE.md` - Core architecture principles
3. `memory-repo/PROJECT_ISOLATION_RULES.md` - Project isolation guidelines
4. `memory-repo/PATTERNS/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_STANDARD.md` - Handoff template structure

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Update README.md files to reference the 8-section handoff template
2. Ensure WAITING_ON.md references the handoff document
3. Verify handoff template example implementation matches all 8 sections
4. Remove or archive previous handoff implementation documents once confirmed

## KNOWN ISSUES/BLOCKERS
* The original handoff template was too complex (18 sections) and resource-intensive
* Some documentation may still reference the previous handoff approach 
* Need to ensure all references to handoff process are consistent

## PROJECT CONTEXT
The memory-repo repository provides a structured three-tier memory system enabling AI context persistence across sessions. It follows project isolation rules with standardized directory structure and file formats.

## CURRENT STATUS
* **Phase:** Implementation
* **Progress:** 85% complete
* **Last Activity:** Created 8-section handoff template

## KEY DECISIONS
* **Simplified Handoff:** 8-section format balances thoroughness with efficiency
* **Validation Questions:** Added to ensure proper knowledge transfer
* **PROJECT Structure:** Three-tier architecture (PROJECT/SESSION/DOCUMENTS)
* **Chat Folders:** Using timestamp format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_name

## TIPS FOR NEXT SESSION
* Always verify handoff references in WAITING_ON.md
* Use relative paths rather than absolute when referencing files
* Prioritize critical files in the Essential Files section
* SESSION directory should maintain timestamp-formatted chat folders
