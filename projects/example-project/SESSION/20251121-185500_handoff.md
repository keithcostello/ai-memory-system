# AI Handoff: Example Project

## Session Information
**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Time:** 18:55
**AI:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet
**Session Duration:** 2 hours
**Repository:** memory-repo

## Project Context
This is a template example project demonstrating the three-tier storage model and project isolation principles. It serves as the base structure for new projects created in the repository.

## Current Status
* **Phase:** Setup/Documentation
* **Progress:** 100% complete for template structure
* **Last Activity:** Completed all structural files and documentation
* **Environment:** GitHub repository template

## Essential Files (Read In This Order)
1. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/WAITING_ON.md` - Current project state and next actions
2. `projects/example-project/SESSION/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` - Current session context
3. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/COMMON_MISTAKES.md` - Project-specific patterns to avoid
4. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` - Key project decisions
5. `PATTERNS/AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` - Protocol for handoffs (this document's template)

## Key Decisions
* **Directory Structure:** Implemented three-tier storage (PROJECT/SESSION/DOCUMENTS) (See `projects/example-project/README.md`)
* **FIFO Policy:** 500-line limits for PROJECT files, 100-line target for CURRENT_CONTEXT.md, 750-line limit for chat logs
* **Project Isolation:** All project files must be contained within the project directory structure

## Open Issues
* **None for template:** This is a completed template structure

## Next Steps
1. Use this template as the basis for creating real projects
2. When creating a real project, update project-specific information
3. Follow the project isolation principle for all new files

## Tips for Next Session
* Review the example-project README.md first for overall structure understanding
* The three-tier storage model (cold/warm/hot) is fundamental to the system
* Pay careful attention to the FIFO policies for different file types
* Use the timestamp format for all chat folders and handoffs

## Unresolved Questions
* None for the template project

## Additional Context
This template project demonstrates all required structural elements. Each real project created from this template will need its own specific content, but should maintain the same directory structure and file organization principles.

All pattern files in the PATTERNS directory are cross-project resources that apply to all projects in the repository. These should be read for understanding the system's architectural principles.
