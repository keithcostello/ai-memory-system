# AI Handoff: example-project

## Session Information
**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Time:** 19:00
**AI:** Claude-3.7-Sonnet
**Session Duration:** 2 hours
**Repository:** jarvis-memory-baseline

## Project Context
Example project demonstrating the memory baseline structure and handoff protocol. This is a template project that showcases proper file organization and session continuity.

## Current Status
* **Phase:** Implementation
* **Progress:** 75% complete
* **Last Activity:** Implemented handoff protocol documentation
* **Environment:** Standard repository template

## Essential Files (Read In This Order)
1. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/WAITING_ON.md` - Current project state
2. `projects/example-project/PROJECT/COMMON_MISTAKES.md` - Project-specific pitfalls
3. `projects/example-project/SESSION/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` - Recent session context
4. `PATTERNS/AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` - Protocol documentation
5. `projects/example-project/SESSION/20251121-175530_example/chat.log` - Recent conversation

## Key Decisions
* **Structure Standardization:** All projects follow the three-tier architecture (See `projects/example-project/PROJECT/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md#decision-1`)
* **Timestamp Format:** Chat folders use YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_name format for consistent organization
* **FIFO Maintenance:** All files have specific line limits and follow first-in-first-out archiving

## Open Issues
* **Documentation Completion:** Several sections need more detailed examples
* **Integration Testing:** Need to verify handoff process works end-to-end with different AI systems

## Next Steps
1. Complete the documentation with more detailed examples
2. Add reference to handoff in WAITING_ON.md
3. Test the handoff process with a simulated session transition
4. Finalize the implementation and update SESSION_LOG.md

## Tips for Next Session
* Review the AI_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md for the complete template structure
* Follow the Essential Files reading order to quickly get context
* Check for any updates to the COMMON_MISTAKES.md before implementing new features

## Unresolved Questions
* How should handoff files be archived when they become outdated?
* Should we include a standardized format for recording session metrics?
* What additional sections might be valuable in the handoff template?
